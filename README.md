# The Easy Eater

The Easy Eater is a meal planning app which is designed to take the stress out of everyday cooking. The app is targeted towards users who enjoy their food and trying new recipes but also want to save time and effort when deciding what to cook for dinner every night of the week!

The site acts as a respository for recipes whereby users can store their own recipes and also browse other user's recipes and bookmark them for a later date. User's can get organised for the week ahead by adding recipes to their mealplanner for each day of the week.

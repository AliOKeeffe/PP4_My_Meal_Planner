## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the develop process using an agile approach. Please see link to project here. INSERT LINK

The 6 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

### Design

The site has a very simple and clean design which was purposely chosen in order to keep in theme with the site's goal. i.e. invoking a sense of calm in the user and reducing stress when it comes to everyday cooking. 


### Colour Scheme
Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Palette](docs/readme_images/colour_scheme.png)

The colour scheme of the site is mainly mainly pale cream, pink and brown with thin gold borders. THe colours chosen are quite neutral and calming. 

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility. 

### Imagery
There is only one static image on the site depicting a family dinner on the home page. The rest of the imagery will be uploaded by users for their individual recipes. 


### Fonts
The Montserrat font is the main font used used for the body of the website with the Playfair Display font used for the main headings on the home page. These fonts were imported via Google Fonts. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.




### Layout

### Wireframes

### Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views. 

#### Database Schema
![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/database_schema.png)


### Security Features and Defensive Design

#### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. 
- Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure users can only edit/delete recipes and comments for which they are the author. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

#### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

#### Database Security
The database secret key is stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

#### Custom error pages:

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.
